# Temperature Forecast

In this project, we perform a forecast of temperature values from 2009 to 2017 with lectures every 10 seconds. We have a total of 4.2 x 10^5 values, this allow us to generate a precise prediction using LSTM layer API. Our principal motivation, is to gain experience to implement it in the bitcoin project.
